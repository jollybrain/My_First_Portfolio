        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>              
            Hey there! I’m Thabiso, a frontend developer in the making with a love for technology and a passion for people.
            Currently, I’m honing my skills at ALX Africa while working as a supervisor at Starbucks, where I’ve mastered the art of balancing communication, leadership, and great coffee. My ability to think on my feet, work seamlessly with others, and tackle challenges makes me not just a team player but a creative problem solver.
            
            I’m all about bringing ideas to life through code, and I’m excited to dive deep into frontend development to create intuitive, user-friendly web experiences. If you’re looking for someone who’s not just skilled but also fun, forward-thinking, and genuinely collaborative, I’m your guy. Let’s build something awesome together!
